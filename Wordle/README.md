Wordle Game
Introduction

Wordle is a simple word-guessing game. The game prompts the player to guess a word of a specified length. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. The game provides feedback on each guess to help the player narrow down the correct answer.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or above
Random module (included in Python standard library)
How to Play
Open the terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the game script is located.
Run the script using the Python interpreter:
python wordle.py <word_length>

Replace <word_length> with an integer value between 5 and 8 (inclusive). This specifies the length of the word to be guessed.
The game will start and prompt you to enter a word of the specified length.
Enter your guess and press Enter.
The game will provide feedback on each guess and prompt you to make another guess.
Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
The game will announce whether you won or lost, and show the number of attempts made.
